## ⚡ Quickstart Guide

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
* **Firebase CLI** installed globally (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
* **Git** installed

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plantopia.git
   cd plantopia
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Firebase**

   * Create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   * Enable **Authentication** (Google Sign-In), **Firestore**, and **Cloud Storage**
   * Obtain your Firebase configuration and add it to `.env.local`:

     ```env
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
     ```

4. **Initialize Firebase in the Project**

   * Create a `firebase.ts` file in the `lib/` directory:

     ```typescript
     // lib/firebase.ts
     import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
     import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';
     import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';
     import { getStorage } from 'firebase/storage';

     const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
       authDomain: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
       projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
       storageBucket: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
       messagingSenderId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
       appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
     };

     const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

     const auth = getAuth(app);
     const db = getFirestore(app);
     const storage = getStorage(app);

     export { auth, db, storage };
     ```

5. **Run the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.
